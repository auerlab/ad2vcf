# ad2vcf

## Description

ad2vcf extracts allelic depth info from a SAM stream and adds it to a
corresponding single-sample VCF file.

SAM input is read via stdin and the VCF input file is taken as a command-line
argument.  This allows expensive BAM/CRAM decoding to occur in-parallel using
a pipe:

```sh
samtools view -@ 2 --input-fmt-option required_fields=0x218 \
    ../SRR6990379/NWD102903.b38.irc.v1.cram \
    | ./ad2vcf file.vcf
```

Both SAM and VCF inputs must be sorted first by chromosome and then by
read/call position.

## Design and Implementation

The code is organized following basic object-oriented design principals, but
implemented in C to minimize overhead and keep the source code accessible to
scientists who don't have time to master the complexities of C++.

Structures are treated as classes, with accessor macros and mutator functions
provided, so dependent applications and libraries need not access
structure members directly.  Since the C language cannot enforce this, it's
up to application programmers to exercise self-discipline.

ad2vcf is written entirely in C and attempts to optimize CPU, memory,
and disk access.  It does not inhale large amounts of data into RAM, so memory
use is trivial and it runs mostly from cache, making it very fast.

Processing a large CRAM file with human genome alignments against from the SRA
project against dbGaP VCF data takes about 20 minutes on a modern workstation
or server with ad2vcf averaging 4 to 5 MB (not GB) resident memory use.
Memory use will spike briefly due to alignment buffering when processing
regions where many alignments overlap multiple variant calls.

## Building and installing

ad2vcf is intended to build cleanly in any POSIX environment on
any CPU architecture.  Please
don't hesitate to open an issue if you encounter problems on any
Unix-like system.

Primary development is done on FreeBSD with clang, but the code is frequently
tested on Linux, MacOS, NetBSD, and OpenIndiana as well.  MS Windows is not supported,
unless using a POSIX environment such as Cygwin or Windows Subsystem for Linux.

The Makefile is designed to be friendly to package managers, such as
[Debian packages](https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages),
[FreeBSD ports](https://www.freebsd.org/ports/),
[MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/), [pkgsrc](https://pkgsrc.org/), etc.
End users should install via one of these if at all possible.

I maintain a FreeBSD port and a pkgsrc package, which is sufficient to install
cleanly on virtually any POSIX platform.  If you would like to see a
package in another package manager, please consider creating a package
yourself.  This will be one of the easiest packages in the collection and
hence a good vehicle to learn how to create packages.

For an overview of available package managers, see the
[Repology website](https://repology.org/).

### Installing ad2vcf on FreeBSD:

FreeBSD is a highly underrated platform for scientific computing, with over
2,000 scientific libraries and applications in the FreeBSD ports collection
(of more than 30,000 total), modern clang compiler, fully-integrated ZFS
filesystem, and renowned security, performance, and reliability.
FreeBSD has a somewhat well-earned reputation for being difficult to set up
and manage compared to user-friendly systems like [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/).
However, if you're a little bit Unix-savvy, you can very quickly set up a
workstation, laptop, or VM using
[desktop-installer](http://www.acadix.biz/desktop-installer.php).

To install the binary package on FreeBSD:

```
pkg install ad2vcf
```

You can just as easily build and install from source.  This is useful for
FreeBSD ports with special build options, for building with non-portable
optimizations such as -march=native, and for 
[work-in-progress ports](https://github.com/outpaddling/freebsd-ports-wip),
for which binary packages are not yet maintained.

```
cd /usr/ports/biology/ad2vcf && env CFLAGS='-march=native -O2' make install
cd /usr/ports/wip/ad2vcf && make install
```

### Installing via pkgsrc

pkgsrc is a cross-platform package manager that works on any Unix-like
platform. It is native to [NetBSD](https://www.netbsd.org/) and well-supported
on [Illumos](https://illumos.org/), [MacOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/),
[RHEL](https://www.redhat.com)/[CentOS](https://www.centos.org/), and
many other Linux distributions.
Using pkgsrc does not require admin privileges.  You can install a pkgsrc
tree in any directory to which you have write access and easily install any
of the nearly 20,000 packages in the collection.

The
[auto-pkgsrc-setup](https://github.com/outpaddling/auto-admin/blob/master/User-scripts/auto-pkgsrc-setup)
script will help you install pkgsrc in about 10 minutes.  Just download it
and run

```
sh auto-pkgsrc-setup
```

Then, assuming you selected current packages and the default prefix

```
source ~/Pkgsrc/pkg/etc/pkgsrc.sh   # Or pkgsrc.csh for csh or tcsh
cd ~/Pkgsrc/biology/ad2vcf
sbmake install clean clean-depends
```

See the pkgsrc documentation for more information.

Community support for pkgsrc is available through the
[pkgsrc-users](http://netbsd.org/mailinglists) mailing list.

### Building ad2vcf locally

Below are cave man install instructions for development purposes, not
recommended for regular use.

ad2vcf depends on [biolibc](https://github.com/auerlab/biolibc).
Install biolibc before attempting to build ad2vcf.

1. Clone the repository
2. Run "make depend" to update Makefile.depend
3. Run "make install"

The default install prefix is ../local.  Clone ad2vcf, biolibc and dependent
apps into sibling directories so that ../local represents a common path to all
of them.

To facilitate incorporation into package managers, the Makefile respects
standard make/environment variables such as CC, CFLAGS, PREFIX, etc.  

The library, headers, and man pages are installed under
`${DESTDIR}${PREFIX}`.  DESTDIR is empty by default and is primarily used by
package managers to stage installations.  PREFIX defaults to ../local.

Add-on libraries required for the build, such as biolibc, should be found
under either `${PREFIX}` or `${LOCALBASE}`, which defaults to `${PREFIX}`.
LOCALBASE can be set independently if you want to use libraries installed
by FreeBSD ports (/usr/local), MacPorts (/opt/local), pkgsrc (/usr/pkg), etc.

To install directly to /myprefix, assuming biolibc is installed there as well,
using a make variable:

```
make PREFIX=/myprefix clean depend install
```

Using an environment variable:

```
# C-shell and derivatives
setenv PREFIX /myprefix
make clean depend install

# Bourne shell and derivatives
PREFIX=/myprefix
export PREFIX
make clean depend install
```

View the Makefile for full details.
